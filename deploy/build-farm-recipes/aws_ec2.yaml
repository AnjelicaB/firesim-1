# Build-time build farm design configuration for the FireSim Simulation Manager
# See https://docs.fires.im/en/stable/Advanced-Usage/Manager/Manager-Configuration-Files.html for documentation of all of these params.

#   # Class name of the build farm type.
#   # This can be determined from `deploy/buildtools/buildfarm.py`).
#   build_farm_type: <TYPE NAME>
#   args:
#       # Build farm arguments that are passed to the `BuildFarmHostDispatcher`
#       # object. Determined by looking at `parse_args` function of class.
#       <K/V pairs of args>

# Note: For large designs (ones that would fill a EC2.2xlarge/Xilinx VU9P)
# Vivado uses in excess of 32 GiB. Keep this in mind when selecting a
# non-default instance type.
