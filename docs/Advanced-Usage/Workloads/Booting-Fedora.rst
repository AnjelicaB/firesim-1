Running Fedora on FireSim
=====================================
FireSim supports running a fedora-based linux workload. To build this workload,
you can follow FireMarshal's `quickstart guide
<https://firemarshal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_ (replace all
instances of ``br-base.json`` with ``fedora-base.json``).
