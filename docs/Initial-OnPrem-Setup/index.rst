Initial Setup/Installation
================================

This section will guide you through initial setup of a single on-premise (self-owned) machine to support
FireSim, as well as cloning/installing FireSim on that machine.
Please refer to the :ref:`Advanced Docs:` for additional ways to extend the on-premise support to arbitrary externally provisioned clusters or multiple FPGAs.
