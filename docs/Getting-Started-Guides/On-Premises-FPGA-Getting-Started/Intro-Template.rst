|fpga_name| Getting Started Guide
=======================================

The getting started guides that follow this page will guide you through the complete flow for
getting an example FireSim simulation up and running using an on-premises |fpga_name|_ FPGA. 
At the end of this guide, you'll have a simulation of a single RISC-V Rocket-based 
SoC booting Linux. After this, we'll show you how to build your own FPGA
bitstreams with customized hardware.  After you complete these guides, you can
look at the "Advanced Docs" in the sidebar to the left.

Here's a high-level outline of what we'll be doing in this guide:
