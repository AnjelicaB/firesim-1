Initial Setup/Installation
================================

This section will guide you through initial setup of a single on-premises (self-owned) machine to support
FireSim, as well as cloning/installing FireSim on that machine.
Please refer to the "Advanced Docs" for additional ways to extend the on-premises support to arbitrary externally provisioned clusters or multiple FPGAs.
